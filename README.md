# Recipe-Book
"Sabor a salud" recipe book platform created using C# and Microsoft SQL.

This project is built around an SQL database with which a standalone and a web app interact. 

The purpose is to provide people with common medical conditions or simply trying to eat healthy a platform where they can find a variaty of nutritionist-curated recipes that suit their necessities.

The standalone app is used for the management (insertion, modification and deletion) of core data. The web app is designed for users to browse recipes, add them to a weekly plan and save a groceries shopping list. Aditionally, the web app allows our certified nutricionists to create and update recipes.
